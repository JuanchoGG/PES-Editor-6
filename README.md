# PES-Editor-6
###### Fork of purplehaze's excellent PES6 Editor
\
Based on PES2009 editor (GPLv3 licenced) from [purplehaze](http://www.purplehaze.eclipse.co.uk/downloads.html) and reverse-engineered offsets from his [PES_Editor_6.0.6](http://www.purplehaze.eclipse.co.uk/downloads/PES_Editor_6.0.6.zip).

Packed as Eclipse project, with addition of 2 simple bash build scripts (` sh build.sh ` and ` sh run.sh `) for GNU/Linux with base OpenJDK.  

### New features
* PSD search (based on [pesstatsdatabase-API](https://github.com/lazanet/pesstatsdatabase-API) of mine) - at Tools->Get PSD Stats
* PSD stat paste (at player edit dialog)

### Binary builds
[HERE!](https://github.com/lazanet/PES-Editor-6/releases/)
 
### TODO
* CSV import (maybe)
* Online rooster generator (maybe)
